      "summary": "The Book in Three Sentences: Practicing meditation and mindfulness will make you at least 10 percent happier. Being mindful doesn\u2019t change the problems in your life, but mindfulness does help you respond to your problems rather than react to them. Mindfulness helps you realize that striving for success is fine as long as you accept that the outcome is outside your control."

The biggest mistake most people make in life is not setting goals high enough. Taking massive action is the only way to fulfill your true potential."
